# Story React Quickstart

This is an example project that shows you how to run a transaction with the Story SDK in a React/Next.js setting.

## Setup

1. `npm install`

2. Create a Privy project at https://dashboard.privy.io. You can use any wallet solution you want, I just used Privy for this example.

3. `cp .env.example .env`

4. Add your Privy App ID to your .env file

5. `npm run dev`

6. Make sure to log in with a wallet that has some test $IP. You can use a faucet to get some test IP [here](https://docs.story.foundation/network/connect/aeneid#faucet).

7. Register a test IP by logging in and clicking "Register Test IP".
